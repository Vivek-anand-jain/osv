## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/vivek-anand-jain/osv.git -b cloudlab-instructions 
cd osv && git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/setup.py
```

## Compile an example into OSv

Find the example in apps/ directory. You might have to install some dependecies
manually. For example, to build golang applications, you have to install golang.

```
./scripts/build -j`nproc` image=<directory name>
```

## Run the OSv unikernel image on QEMU-KVM
```
./scripts/run.py -p kvm --nogdb --novnc
```
